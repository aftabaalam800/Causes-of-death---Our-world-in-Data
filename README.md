Project Overview
In this project, I tackled 70+ SQL problems ranging from basic queries to complex analytical queries. I then visualized the results using Power BI to create an informative and interactive dashboard.

Datasets
The analysis is based on two primary datasets:

Causes of Death: Data related to various causes of death across different years and entities.
Execution Data: Data from Amnesty International detailing the number of executions between 1990 and 2001.
SQL Problems
I categorized the problems into different levels and topics:

Basic Queries: Simple retrieval and filtering of data.
Aggregation & Grouping: Summarizing data using aggregate functions.
Joins & Subqueries: Combining multiple datasets and complex filtering.
Window Functions: Advanced calculations across a dataset.
Advanced Aggregation: More intricate summarization techniques.
Advanced Filtering: Complex criteria for data retrieval.
Data Modification: Creating, updating, and deleting data.
Complex Queries: Multi-step queries involving advanced SQL concepts.
Analytical Queries: Analysis using SQL functions and custom logic.
Data Exploration & Visualization: Preparing data for visualization.
Key Problems Solved
Retrieve total deaths caused by "Meningitis" in Afghanistan over all available years.
Calculate the running total of deaths caused by "HIV/AIDS" from 2007 to 2016.
Write a query to predict the number of deaths for "Cardiovascular diseases" in 2018 based on historical data.
Analyze the correlation between deaths caused by "Conflict and terrorism" and "Road injuries".
Data Visualization with Power BI
The final part of the project involved creating an attractive and interactive dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard includes:

Time Series Charts: Showing trends over the years.
Correlation Analysis: Visualizing relationships between different causes of death.
Pivot Tables: Summarizing deaths by cause and year.
Heatmaps: Displaying the concentration of deaths across different causes and years.
How to Use This Repository
SQL Solutions: The SQL_Solutions folder contains all the SQL queries used to solve the problems.
Power BI Dashboard: The Power_BI folder includes the .pbix file for the Power BI dashboard. You can open this file in Power BI Desktop to explore the visualizations.
Datasets: The Datasets folder contains the data used for analysis.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates my proficiency in SQL and data visualization. I aimed to solve complex problems and present insights in a clear and compelling manner through the Power BI dashboard.
